Let's say you have a source table named raw_sales in your data warehouse, and you want to create an aggregated table named monthly_sales. Here's how you might define this in a DBT model:

sql
-- models/monthly_sales.sql

WITH raw_sales_data AS (
  SELECT
    date_trunc('month', sale_date) as month,
    product_id,
    SUM(sale_amount) as total_sales
  FROM
    raw_sales
  GROUP BY
    1, 2
)

SELECT
  month,
  product_id,
  total_sales
FROM
  raw_sales_data;

In this example, the monthly_sales model aggregates the raw sales data by month and product. This is just a simplified example, and DBT allows for much more complex transformations.

Running DBT:
To run DBT and build your models, you would typically use the command line:

bash
dbt run

This command will execute the transformations defined in your DBT models and update the tables or views in your data warehouse accordingly.

DBT is often used in conjunction with tools like Apache Airflow or other orchestration tools to schedule and automate the execution of data transformations.
