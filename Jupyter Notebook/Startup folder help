The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows): 

jupyter notebook

This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.

When started, the Jupyter Notebook App can access only files within its start-up folder (including any sub-folder). No configuration is necessary if you place your notebooks in your home folder or subfolders. 
Otherwise, you need to choose a Jupyter Notebook App start-up folder which will contain all the notebooks.

In Anaconda Prompt:
(base) C:\>D:
(base) D:\>jupyter notebook
